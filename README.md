# Transcendence â€“ A Multiplayer Pong Game with Microservices Architecture

Transcendence is a fully functional online multiplayer Pong game built using a **microservices architecture**. The project was developed over 1.5 months as part of an intensive learning experience, focusing on modern backend and frontend technologies.

## Key Features & Tech Stack

- **Microservices Backend**: Built using **Django**, **PostgreSQL**, **NGINX**, **Redis** structured as independent Docker containers for scalability and modularity.
- **Real-time Gameplay**: Game logic is handled server-side, with **WebSockets** enabling smooth multiplayer interaction. Players can also challenge an **AI opponent**.
- **User Management & Authentication**: A dedicated authentication service ensures secure user registration, login, and session management.
- **Frontend SPA**: A lightweight **JavaScript** single-page application (SPA) with a retro Pong design, styled with **Bootstrap**.

## Challenges & Learning Experience

Before this project, we had little to no experience with **Django, microservices, or SPAs**, but we took on the challenge and delivered a working product. Along the way, we learned how to:

- Design and orchestrate **microservices** using **Docker**.
- Implement **real-time multiplayer logic** with WebSockets.
- Structure a **RESTful API** for game and user management.
- Build and deploy a **scalable web application**.

The code isn't perfect, and there are still improvements to be made, but this project marks a significant milestone in our growth as developers. Weâ€™re excited to keep refining our skills and tackling even bigger challenges in the future! ðŸš€
